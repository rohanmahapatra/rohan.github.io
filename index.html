        </p>
<p>I am a first year graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,
advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sinclair/"> Prof. Matt Sinclair</a>.
I am specializing in Computer Architecture domain and currently working on potential microarchitectural changes to GPGPUs to enable real time Machine Learning algorithms to run efficiently.
</p>
<p>
In the past, I have worked as SOC Design Engineer at Intel Corporation working on integration of IA Cores, cache coherent fabric and I/O Peripherals (I2C, I3C, UART, SDCARDs.
</p>
<p>Previously, I was an undergraduate at National Instititue of Technology Sikkim, from which I received a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering in the year 2016 and was placed 2nd in my batch.

<h3>Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong></strong><b>
Accelerating Real Time Machine Learning Algorithms by potential microarchitecturals changes to Memory Heirarchy of GPGPUs</b> <br />
<em>Guide: Prof. Matt Sinclair, University of Wisconsin Madison</em>,  Aug. 2018 - till date.<br />
Simulating Deep Neural Network Algorithms used for Real Time Object Detection especially in Autonomous
Driving Vehicles using GPGPUsim to nd micro-architectural bottlenecks which limit performance and nding
possible solutions to accelerate these bottlenecks
(<a href="">Report</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> Designing and FPGA implementation of novel AES algorithm by substituting static S-Box with Dynamic Cellular Automata</strong> <br />
<em>Indian Insititue of Technology Guwahati and National Institute of Technology Sikkim</em>,  June. 2014 - Dec 2015<br />
Redesigned the architecture of Advanced Encryption Standard's Substitution-Box with Cellular Automata to make it more secure. Moreover, modelled the algorithm in Xilinx Virtex FPGA to calculate maximum operating frequency, power and resource utilization.

<h3>Work Experience and Internships</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong></strong><b>
SoC Design Engineer, Intel Corporation, Bangalore, India</b> <br />
<em>June 2016 - July 2018<br /></em>
I was on integrating IA Cores, cache coherent fabric, serial I/O controllers (I3C, SPI, UART & eMMC) in the next generation client and mobile SoCs. I also contributed to I/O Controller Specification development, RTL Design and Timing Closure for SoC. In another client project, I worked on developing reusable test cases from scratch for Functional Validation and Toggle Coverage of DMA using OVM methodology. I also developed test cases for functional validation of Performance Monitors in IA Cores. I gained comprehensive
understanding of Intel Core Architecture and SoC Flows</p>

<p><strong></strong><b>
Summer Research Trainee, Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, India</b> <br />
<em>May 2015 - July 2015<br /></em>
Hands-on experience on transistor (HEMT) fabrication and electrical characterization using DC Probe Station. Simulated the band structure of the HEMTs using a proprietary software</p>

<h3> Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong></strong><b>
Design, Synthesis and FPGA implmentation of Segway Controller</b> <br />
<em>Course Project for Digital System Design and Synthesis</em>, Dec 2018.<br />
As a part of this project, I was part of a team designing segway controller which had a digital core (with PID controller) that could control and balance a Segway Scooter. The basic functionality was that depending on the rider, battery status and authentication using UART interface the Segway scooter will accelerate and depending on the Gyro reading which uses a SPI interface, it will try to balance the rider on the scooter.
This project involved RTL development, testbench creation, Synthesis (using Synopsys DC), Post-Synthesis Validation, STA, Code Coverage and FPGA mapping (Altera Cyclone IV FPGA)
